Modifying the TFS Template
--------------------------

Watcher TFS can be configured to support any required fields for the generated
work items by clicking the Edit Template button the Watcher Configuration tab.
If an error occurs during the submission of work items to TFS, try modifying
the template to match your TFS project's schema.

The Watcher TFS template contains further information on the properties it 
defines.

Caveats
-------

1.  Watcher TFS Fails to Load on 64-bit Operating Systems

The Team Foundation assemblies are built for x86 only.  This means that they
will fail to load when running Watcher on x64 platforms.  Fortunately, Fiddler
provides the ForceCPU application, which allows Fiddler (and thus Watcher) to
run in x86 mode.  To run Fiddler in x86 mode, run the following commands from
the Fiddler directory as an Administrator:

	ForceCPU x86
	Fiddler

NOTE: Running Fiddler in x86 mode on an x64 platform may break SSL interception.

Known Issues
-------------

1.  TFS binaries are not included with the plugin.  You must install TFS and obtain the DLLs yourself.
2.  TFS binaries only come in 32-bit flavor and will not work with Fiddler when running as a 64-bit executable.
3.  Watcher currently does not customize the Severity or Priority fields in the work item based on the severity rating of the finding being saved.
4.  The progress UI may occasionally disappear or fail to update.
